# Web_programming_project

A project that we submitted for a web programming introductory class in my first year at Ecole Polytechnique(course CSE104 - Bachelor Program) The project is a collection of small, mathy and addictive minigames. The webpage includes a home page with a short description along with the links to the three video games. 

Author: Do Bach Khoa and Nguyen Ngoc Tu.

## Reference:

We would also attribute the following sources that we have referred to during the project. Firstly, our
game choice is inspired by the mobile app Jason Statham Game Collection.

On the website, we included the links to the following Wikipedia pages that are about the history and
the mathematical mechanics of the games.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

We also looked up the codes from the following site to define the shuffle function for one of our lists,
which applies the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm.
